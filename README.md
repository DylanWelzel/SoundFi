# Sound Fi

## Summary
[Sound Fi](https://sound-fi.herokuapp.com/) is a web application inspired by my time learning at App Academy. Lofi music was a huge help in making it through the 60+ hour weeks and I wanted to build something related to that. Sound Fi is a soundcloud clone with my own design that uses file upload with cloudinary's API and plays audio with React Audio Player.

Sound Fi allows users to:
* create an account
* log into an existing account
* log out of an account
* create/edit/delete and view uploaded songs
* can play individual songs or a playlist of songs individually

## Overall Structure
### Back End
The back end was built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and it utilizes a postgreSQL database.

### Front End
The front end was built with React and Redux.

### Technologies
Sound Fi uses:
* JavaScript
* Express
* React
* Cloudinary API
* CSS
